# Welcome to GitLens

[GitLens](https://gitkraken.com/gitlens?utm_source=gitlens-extension&utm_medium=in-app-links&utm_campaign=gitlens-logo-links 'Learn more about GitLens') is an [open-source](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens 'Open GitLens on GitHub') extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Coding is a team sport. Collaborating early and often with these new rich features is crucial for avoiding delays and delivering high quality code with little rework.  That‚Äôs why we developed additional GitLens features marked with the sparkle symbol ‚ú®. These features are free to use on public and local repos but made for professional developers and development teams. When you want to use these features on Private Repos you will need a GitLens Pro subscription. You can see the breakdown of GitLens account levels below.

With just a click of a button, you can navigate backwards and forwards through any file‚Äôs history. Compare changes over time and see the revision history of the whole file or every individual line of code. Customizable and unobtrusive Git blame annotations are still shown on every line, telling you the author, date, and message for the last commit!

## File Annotations [#](#file-annotations- 'File Annotations')

See customizable file annotations in the editor‚Äôs status bar and in the gutter. Choose between, Blame ‚Äì showing the commit and author for each line. Changes ‚Äì highlighting any local, unpublished, changes or lines changed by the most recent commit. Heatmap ‚Äì to show how recently lines were changed relative to all the other changes in the file.

## Blame, Changes, Heatmap [#](#blame-changes-heatmap- 'Blame, Changes, Heatmap')

Blame, Changes, and Heatmap that enhance the overall functionality and visibility of Git repositories. With the Blame feature, users can easily trace the authorship and modification history of specific lines of code, helping to understand the context and accountability behind changes. Additionally, the Heatmap feature provides a visual representation of code activity, highlighting hotspots and cold spots based on frequency and recency of changes, assisting teams in identifying critical areas and optimizing their development efforts. Together, these features empower developers with a comprehensive understanding of their codebase, fostering collaboration and enabling more efficient workflows.

## ‚ú®Commit Graph [#](#commit-graph- 'Commit Graph')

The easy-to-read GitKraken Commit Graph will help you visualize branch structure and commit history. With its visual format and full-featured context menus, you can quickly search for commits and interact with branches, commits, tags, and more, streamlining your team‚Äôs workflow and improving your productivity.

Use the rich commit search to find exactly what you're looking for. It's powerful filters allow you to search by a specific commit, message, author, a changed file or files, or even a specific code change.

## ‚òÅÔ∏èFocus View [#](#focus-view- 'Focus View')

Streamline your workflow and prioritize your tasks with Focus View. This view gives you a comprehensive list of all your most important work across all your GitHub repos. No more jumping back and forth between multiple pages or repos ‚Äì GitLens Focus View makes it simple and efficient to keep track of and manage your work progress.

Focus View provides you with a summary of Pull Requests and Issues relevant to you for the repositories grouped in your Workspace.

 - My Pull Requests: shows all GitHub PRs opened by you, assigned to you, or awaiting your review
 - My Issues: shows all issues created by you, assigned to you, or that mention you.

## ‚òÅÔ∏èWorkspaces [#](#workspaces- 'Workspaces')

Workspaces in GitLens are a convenient way to group and manage multiple repositories, making them easily accessible from anywhere. Whether you're working individually or collaborating with a team, Workspaces provide a seamless way to manage your projects. A Workspace can be made up of local repositories, those you currently have open in your VS Code window, or GitKraken Workspaces, which are repositories stored on the cloud or on GitKraken services.

Please note that while using cloud workspaces requires a free account, shared cloud workspaces require a trial or subscription. Shared Workspaces functionality is coming soon to GitLens.

Whether you're working individually or collaborating with a team, these new features are designed to help you work more efficiently and effectively.

## Sidebar Views [#](#sidebar-views- 'Sidebar Views')

GitLens enhances the VS Code experience by adding various sidebar views such as Commits, File History, Branches, Remotes, Stashes, Tags, Contributors, and the Search & Compare view, each of which provides rich and helpful functionality. The default layout of these views can be easily customized to help you streamline your workflow, improve productivity, and easily access the information they need.

## ‚ú®Visual File History [#](#visual-file-history- 'Visual File History')

The Visual File History view provides a dynamic illustration of a file's evolution, showcasing when changes occurred, their scale, and the individuals who contributed to those changes. It's an essential tool for pinpointing the most significant changes in a file's history or identifying the primary contributors for further discussions about modifications.

Visual File History organizes authors on the left y-axis, constructing a timeline of their commits along the x-axis. The commits are marked as distinct bubbles, color-coded per author, with the size of each bubble denoting the relative impact of the change. Each commit's additions and deletions are displayed as stacked, vertical bars, color-coded to distinguish between added lines (green) and deleted lines (red). The height of these bars mirrors the number of affected lines, providing an at-a-glance understanding of the extent of changes made in each commit.

## ‚ú®Worktrees [#](#worktrees- 'Worktrees')

Worktrees enhance multitasking by reducing the need to constantly switch between branches, thereby enabling seamless concurrent work on different branches within a repository.

Eliminate disruptions to your ongoing tasks while reviewing a pull request. With worktrees, you can effortlessly generate a new worktree and open it in a separate VS Code window, without any interference with your existing work.

Multiple working trees can be created, allowing each to be opened in separate windows or collectively in a single workspace. This flexibility enables efficient management and organization of your work across different branches.

## ‚ú® GitLab and GitHub Self-Managed Integration [#](#gitlab-and-github-self-managed-integration- 'GitLab and GitHub Self-Managed Integration')

Context switching kills productivity. GitLens not only reveals buried knowledge locked within your repository, it also pulls together additional context from issues and pull requests providing you with a wealth of information and insights at your fingertips.

With GitLens Pro, GitLab Self-Managed and GitHub Enterprise users can see avatars for commit authors, richer details for auto-linked issues and merge requests, as well as merge requests associated with commits and branches. This feature helps you save time and stay focused on your work, ultimately improving your productivity and efficiency.

GitLens also provides rich integrations with many remote providers, including GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, Gitea, Gerrit, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server, Azure DevOps and custom servers. Quickly gain insights from pull requests and issues without leaving your codebase.

## Command Palette Commands [#](#command-palette-commands- 'Command Palette Commands')

Save time and boost productivity with this efficient tool that eliminates the need to memorize Git commands. It offers guided, step-by-step access to numerous commonly used Git commands, in addition to quick access to commits (history and search), stashes, and status (current branch and working tree).

## Interactive Rebase Editor [#](#interactive-rebase-editor- 'Interactive Rebase Editor')

GitLens‚Äô interactive rebase feature allows you to easily configure a rebase session by simply dragging and dropping commits to reorder them, and selecting which ones to edit, squash, or drop. This intuitive interface simplifies the complex task of rebasing and ensures that you can easily and efficiently manage their commit history.

# GitLens Labs [#](#gitlens-labs- 'GitLens Labs')
